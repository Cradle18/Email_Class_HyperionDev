# Emai OOP Simulator

I completed this program as part of my HyperionDev Software Development Fundamentals bootcamp. The task was to create a email simulator using OOP, that met the following criteria: 

- Create a Email class and initialise a constructor that takes 3 arguemtns
    - email_address
    - subject_line
    - email_content
- Create class method that change the has_been_read variable
- Create a function that lists the inbox in the terminal
- Create a function that pre populates the inbox
- Create a function for the user to read an email
- Provide a simple user friendly menu that contains the following 3 options
    - Read an email
    - View unread emails
    - Quit application

I have implemented the program in python, and you can find the source code in this repository.
